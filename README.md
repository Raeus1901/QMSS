#  Hello 
Graduated from Columbia University with a M.A in Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences (QMSS), currently in New-York. Find below the various coding assignements I did as part of my time in gradschool alongside to my final thesis. You can find me on [![LinkedIn][3.2]][2]. 


## üìñ Master Thesis

###                     [Master Code](Master%20Thesis)

The study explores the relationship between cognitive biases and investment decisions. Examples include anchoring (doubt about buying a stock) and loss aversion (reluctance to invest based on historical data). Through API extraction on Python, the algorithm retrieves performance data for the five companies with the highest market share in renewable energy from 2014 to 2024.

The hypothesis validation encompasses three critical components.

1) **Sentiment Quantification**: Automated a web crawler to retrieve text corpus from quarterly earning reports, tokenizing it through stemming. Employed the FinBERT model to evaluate nuanced financial words to sentiment scores ranging from -1 to 1.
   
3) **Statistical Significance and Output**: Applied an ARIMA regression using daily stock prices correlated to quarterly earnings results and their sentiment variables. Found evidences of hidden price movements independent of company performance through statistical evidence p-value (‚â• 0;95) and stochastic factors.

4) **Model Statistical Diagnosis**: Diagnosed the model to confirm its reliability. Performed data analysis test to look for lags and autocorrelating factors within the time series, ensured proper data extraction, equalizing the residual variables, minimizing deviation, and standard error score.

Demonstrated a significant relationship between biases over a company and its stock prices during the earning period, finding a decreasing effect before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Concluded on better trust in emerging renewable technologies due to less impactful sentiment score over time. Asserted for more availability of objective information to drive the investor perception on a company's performance based upon the efficient market hypothesis.
