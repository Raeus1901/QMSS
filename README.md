# 🌴 Hello stranger !🌴
 I appreciate you stumbled upon my page and chose to take a look. My name is Jean, and I am current graduate student at Columbia University in the Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences (QMSS) departement. I am originally from France, Paris but I am also half-Argentinean. This git page will provide you with the coding I did part of my program. You can find me on linkedin if you want to connect.
